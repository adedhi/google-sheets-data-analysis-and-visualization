# Google Sheets Data Analysis and Visualization
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts for analyzing and visualizing data from a Google Sheets file which contains the results of a survey measuring academic opinion on the use of ChatGPT in universities. Leveraging pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy, these scripts extract survey data, analyze meaningful insights, and present findings through visually engaging graphs and charts.
